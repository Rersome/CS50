Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
with a small number of simulations there's a chance that some of the teams will swap their chance of winning

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
after 100000 simulations
